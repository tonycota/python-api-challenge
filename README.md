# python-api-challenge
Homework submission for module 6 python api challenge

In this repo you will find two files under the starter code folder including VacantionPy and WeatherPy.
The cities csv file was moved to this folder to simplify code and some directory errors I was encountering in WeatherPy. 
In the same folder you will also find all of the png images from the weatherpy code. 
# Note #
I ran into a handful of problems with the api keys in both files so you will see some commented out code with me trying to debug some issues. 
I wanted to leave the commented out code just so you can see some other tricks I have learned from outside resources. (My brother is my tutor)

In the VacationPy file we can gather information regarding certain criteria entered by the user to help us plan a future vacation. 
I love tropical weather as I am from Hawaii so I tailored my code to export certain hotels in areas that fit my likes. (Saw some familiar places and it made me homesick!)
In the final cell we can see a visualization that shows nearest hotels to the coordinates we used in our dataset. 

For WeatherPy
We've gathered a lot of data from our API to generate visualizations regarding the effects latitude has on certain weather aspects such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness etc.
Please take note of the function I created to visualize linear regressions for northern and southern hemispheres. I'm quite proud of it! 
It took quite some time and a handful of breaks but I managed to generate what I feel is sufficient data. 
# Note #
I limited my final API call to 500 cities as I was trying to debug a 401 error for quite some time and didn't want to hit my daily maximum. 


This was a great project! Incredibly challenging but I am ready to take on my first group project with my classmates.
